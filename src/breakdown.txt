Prelims to Wake up the robot:
- Bring the servos to life and allow the servo board to be awake (initServos)
- Bring the sensors to life, we initialize them to the proper settings (initSensors)

Once it's awake, we are now ready to place objects
- We roll an object down the ramp: 

        First --> the distance sensor detects that an object is rolling on the ramp (checkIfVisible)
        Second --> once the computer knows that an object is coming, it will read the color (readColor)

        Based on the color, it will pick it up and place it in the correct box and that's it

Issue: 
- The color sensor will only read the color if the ball is STILL in front of the sensor
- I need to make sure that the current run is still being completed and does not get interrupted by another object.
    - It should finish the run and then pick up the next object

Solution:
- Using threading to wait for something to finish and then keep going

loop method breakdown in main:
- begin a new thread
- detect the object and read the color of the object
- based on the color, place the object 
- finish thread
- continue and reset thread
