# Robotic Mechanical Arm 

## Description

This robotic arm, built entirely from 3D-printed components and electronics, 
has a claw mechanism and precise movement allowing to pick up and sort objects based on their color autonomously with the combination of sensors.

Full 3D Model of Project: https://a360.co/4f849vz

### Key Features:
- 4 Degree of Freedom Motion (DOF): Base, Shoulder, Forearm, and Wrist
- Each joint supports 180 degree motion, while the base is capable of 360 degree motion.
- Gripper claw (end effector) to pick up and place objects into bins based on color.
- Distance and color sensors for autonomous motion and object detection.
- Fully 3D-printed custom parts.

## Software Overview
The software of coding the robotic arm is in VS Code with PlatformIO System in C++.
- **Stepper Motor Control**: <Stepper.h> Arudino Library
- **Servo Control**: <Adafruit_PWMServoDriver.h> Library
- **Sensors Implementation**: <HCSR04.h> and <tcs3200.h> Library

The robotic arm has an IK (Inverse Kinematic) Algorithm for precise movement and positioning of end effector.
The robot performs tasks autonomously based on the color and distance sensor.
